EVENT BINDING


"""

# The following example illustrates how to use the bind() method to register multiple handlers for the same event:
# When you move the focus to the button and press the Return key, Tkinter automatically invokes the return_pressed and log functions.

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk


def return_pressed(event):
    print("Return key pressed.")


def log(event):
    print(event)


root = tk.Tk()

btn = ttk.Button(root, text="Save")
btn.bind("<Return>", return_pressed)


# The following binds the log() function to the Return key pressed event of the 'Save' button:
btn.bind("<Return>", log, add="+")
# In this statement, the third argument add='+' registered additional handler, which is the log() function.
# If you don’t specify the add='+' argument, the bind() method will replace the existing handler (return_pressed) by the new one (log).


btn.focus()
btn.pack(expand=True)

root.mainloop()

Event patterns

- Tkinter uses event patterns to map event names with handlers. For example, the <Return> denotes the Return key pressed.

- The following shows the general syntax of an event pattern:

    <modifier-type-detail>

- In this syntax, an event is surrounded by angle brackets (<>). Inside the angle brackets, there are zero or more modifiers, an event type, and detailed information about the event.

- For example, the <KeyPress-A> denotes a keyboard press of the key A . and <Alt-Control-KeyPress-KP_Delete> represents a keypress of Alt + Ctrl + Delete.

- The following section shows the most commonly used event modifiers, event types, and event details.


1) Event modifiers

- The following table lists the most commonly used event modifiers:

    Event Modifier	  Meaning
    Alt	              The Alt key is held
    Control	          The Ctrl key is held
    Shift	            The Shift key is held

- Any	This modifier makes an event type general. For example, the event pattern <Any-KeyPress> applies to the keypress of any key.

Binding events to root window

- So far, you have learned how to bind an event to a particular widget. Tkinter also allows you to bind an event to the top-level window.

- In this case, the syntax for the bind() is the same except that you can call it on the root window like this:

    root.bind('<Return>', handler)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

The levels of binding

- In the previous example, you have learned how to bind an event to a particular instance of a widget. This is called an instance-level binding.

- Tkinter also allows you to bind an event to all the instances of a widget. For example, you can bind the event to all the textboxes in a program:

    root.bind_class('Entry', '<Control-V>', paste)

- By the way, you use the Entry widget to create a textbox in Tkinter.

- This is called class-level binding because you bind the event to a class instead of an instance.
Unbinding events

- Sometimes, you may want to undo the effect of an earlier binding. To do it, you can use the unbind() method:

    widget.unbind(event)

- The following example unbinds the event from the btn button:

    btn.unbind('<Return>')

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Summary

    Use the bind() method to bind an event to a widget.
    Tkinter supports both instance-level and class-level bindings.
