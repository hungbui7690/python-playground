"""
STACK
- The stack() function two or more arrays into a single array. Unlike the concatenate() function, the stack() function joins 1D arrays to be one 2D array and joins 2D arrays to be one 3D array.

- The following shows the syntax of the stack() function:

    numpy.stack((a1,a2,...),axis=0)

- In this syntax, the (a1, a2, â€¦) is a sequence of arrays with ndarray type or array-like objects. All arrays a1, a2, .. must have the same shape.
- The axis parameter specifies the axis in the result array along which the function stacks the input arrays. By default, the axis is zero which joins the input arrays vertically.
- Besides the stack() function, NumPy also has vstack() function that joins two or more arrays vertically and hstack() function that joins two or more arrays horizontally.

# 1) Using stack() function to join 1D arrays
# The following example uses the stack() function to join two 1D arrays:
a = np.array([1, 2])
b = np.array([3, 4])

c = np.stack((a, b))
print(c)
# [[1 2]
#  [3 4]]
