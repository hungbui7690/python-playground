"""
and Operator
- The Python and operator is a logical operator. Typically, you use the and operator to operate on Boolean values and return a Boolean value.

- The and operator returns True if both operands evaluate to True. Otherwise, it returns False.

# The following shows an example of using the and operator:
timeout = False
pending_job = True
execute_next = timeout and pending_job

print(execute_next)  # False
