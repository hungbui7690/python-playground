Summary

    An enumeration is a set of members that have associated unique constant values.
    Create a new enumeration by defining a class that inherits from the Enum type of the enum module.
    The members have the same types as the enumeration to which they belong.
    Use the enumeration[member_name] to access a member by its name and enumeration(member_value) to access a member by its value.
    Enumerations are iterable.
    Enumeration members are hashable.
    Enumerable are immutable.
    Cannot inherits from an enumeration unless it has no members.
