Delete Property
- To create a property of a class, you use the @property decorator. Under the hood, the @property decorator uses the property class that has three methods: setter, getter, and deleter.

- By using the deleter, you can delete a property from an object. Notice that the deleter() method deletes a property of an object, not a class.

!! @name.deleter

# The following defines the Person class with the name property:
from pprint import pprint


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        if value.strip() == "":
            raise ValueError("name cannot be empty")
        self._name = value

    # delete decorator
    @name.deleter
    def name(self):
        del self._name


# In the Person class, we use the @name.deleter decorator. Inside the deleter, we use the del keyword to delete the _name attribute of the Person instance.


# The following shows the __dict__ of the Person class:
pprint(Person.__dict__)
