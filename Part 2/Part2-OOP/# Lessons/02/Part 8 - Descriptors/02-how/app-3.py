# The __get__ method
# Python calls the __get__ method of the Personâ€˜s object when you access the first_name attribute. For example:
person = Person()

person.first_name = "John"
# __set__ was called with instance=<__main__.Person object at 0x000001B9B8001710> and value=John

print(person.first_name)
# __get__ was called with instance=<__main__.Person object at 0x000001B9B8001710> and owner=<class '__main__.Person'>
# John


# If the instance is not None, the __get__() method returns the value of the attribute with the name property_name of the instance object.
