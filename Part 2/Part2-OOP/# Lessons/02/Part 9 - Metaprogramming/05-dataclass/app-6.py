Customize attribute behaviors

- If donâ€™t want to initialize an attribute in the __init__ method, you can use the field() function from the dataclasses module.

- The field() function has multiple interesting parameters such as repr, hash, compare, and metadata.

- If you want to initialize an attribute that depends on the value of another attribute, you can use the __post_init__ method. As its name implies, Python calls the __post_init__ method after the __init__ method.

    # The following use the __post_init__ method to initialize the can_vote attribute based on the age attribute:
    def __post_init__(self):
        print("called __post_init__ method")
        self.can_vote = 18 <= self.age <= 70
