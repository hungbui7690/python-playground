Passing arguments to threads

"""

# The following program shows how to pass arguments to the function assigned to a thread:

from time import sleep, perf_counter
from threading import Thread


# First, define a task() function that accepts an argument:
def task(id):
    print(f"Starting the task {id}...")
    sleep(1)
    print(f"The task {id} completed")


start_time = perf_counter()


# Second, create 10 new threads and pass an id to each. The threads list is used to keep track of all newly created threads:
threads = []
for n in range(1, 11):
    t = Thread(target=task, args=(n,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()


# Notice that if you call the join() method inside the loop, the program will wait for the first thread to complete before starting the next one.
# Third, wait for all threads to complete by calling the join() method:
for t in threads:
    t.join()

end_time = perf_counter()

print(f"It took {end_time- start_time: 0.2f} second(s) to complete.")
