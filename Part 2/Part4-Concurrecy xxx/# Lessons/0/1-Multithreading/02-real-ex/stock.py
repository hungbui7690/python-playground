- Every element on a webpage can be selected using something called XPath.
- To get the XPath of an element using Google Chrome, you inspect the page, right-click the element, select copy, and Copy XPath.
- pic
- The XPath of the stock price at the time of writing this tutorial is as follows: 

    //*[@id="quote-header-info"]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/fin-streamer[1]

- To get the text of the element, you append the text() at the end of the XPath:

    //*[@id="quote-header-info"]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/fin-streamer[1]/text()

- Notice that if Yahoo changes the page structure, you need to change the XPath accordingly. Otherwise, the program wonâ€™t work as expected:

    price_text = tree.xpath('//*[@id="quote-header-info"]/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/fin-streamer[1]/text()')
