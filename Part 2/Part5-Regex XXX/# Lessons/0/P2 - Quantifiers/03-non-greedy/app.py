NON-GREEDY

Introduction to the regex non-greedy (or lazy) quantifiers

- Quantifiers allow you to match their preceding elements a number of times. Quantifiers work in one of two modes: greedy and non-greedy (lazy).

- When quantifiers work in the greedy mode, they are called greedy quantifiers. Similarly, when quantifiers work in the non-greedy mode, theyâ€™re called non-greedy quantifiers or lazy quantifiers.

- By default, quantifiers work in the greedy mode. It means the greedy quantifiers will match their preceding elements as much as possible to return to the biggest match possible.

- On the other hand, the non-greedy quantifiers will match as little as possible to return the smallest match possible. non-greedy quantifiers are the opposite of greedy ones.

- To turn greedy quantifiers into non-greedy quantifiers, you add an extra question mark (?) to the quantifiers. The following table shows the greedy and their corresponding non-greedy quantifiers:

        Greedy quantifier	Lazy quantifier	    Meaning
        *	                *?	                Match its preceding element zero or more times.
        +	                +?	                Match its preceding element one or more times.
        ?	                ??	                Match its preceding element zero or one time.
        { n }	            { n }?	            Match its preceding element exactly n times.
        { n ,}	            { n ,}?	            Match its preceding element at least n times.
        { n , m }	        { n , m }?	        Match its preceding element from n to m times.

# The following program uses the non-greedy quantifier (+?) to match the text within the quotes ("") of a button element:

import re

s = '<button type="submit" class="btn">Send</button>'

pattern = '".+?"'
matches = re.finditer(pattern, s)

for match in matches:
    print(match.group())

# "submit"
# "btn"


# Summary
# Non-greedy quantifiers match their preceding elements as little as possible to return the smallest possible match.
# Add a question mark (?) to a quantifier to turn it into a non-greedy quantifier.
