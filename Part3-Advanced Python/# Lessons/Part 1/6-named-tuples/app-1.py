# The following shows a tuple that has two elements:
point = (100, 200)


# The point tuple represents a 2D point whose x-coordinate is 100 and y coordinate is 200.
# To get the x-coordinate and y-coordinate, you can use the following syntax:
x = point[0]
y = point[1]


# This code works fine. However, it’s not so obvious.
# When you look at the point[0], you need to know its implicitly meaning which doesn’t mention in the code.
