What is a Python iterator

- An iterator is an object that implements:

    __iter__ method that returns the object itself.
    __next__ method that returns the next item. If all the items have been returned, the method raises a StopIteration exception.

- Note that these two methods are also known as the iterator protocol.

- Python allows you to use iterators in for loops, comprehensions, and other built-in functions including map, filter, reduce, and zip.

Python iterator example

- A square number is a product of an integer with itself. For example, a square of 2 is 4 (=2*2).

- The following example defines Square iterator class that returns the square numbers.

"""


class Square:
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length
        self.current = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current >= self.length:
            raise StopIteration

        self.current += 1
        return self.current**2


"""
How it works.

  First, initialize the length and current attributes in the __init__ method.

  The length attribute specifies the number of square numbers that the class should return. And the current attribute keeps track of the current integer.

  Second, implement the __iter__ method that returns the self object.

  Third, implement the __next__ method that returns the next square number. If the number of square numbers has been returned is greater than the length, the __next__ method raises the StopIteration exception.
"""

square = Square(5)

for sq in square:
    print(sq)

"""
1
4
9
16
25


How it works:

  First, create a new instance of the Square class.
  Then, use the for loop to iterate over items of the square iterator.

Once you iterate over all the items, the iterator is exhausted. It means you need to create a new iterator to iterate over its items again.

If you attempt to use the iterator that is already exhausted, youâ€™ll get the StopIteration exception. For example:

    next(square)

Also, an iterator cannot be restarted because it only has the __next__ method that returns the next item from a collection.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Summary

  An iterator is an object that implements __iter__ and __next__ methods.
  An iterator cannot be reusable once all items have been returned.
