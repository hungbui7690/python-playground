"""
Define a class
- Everything in Python is an object. An object has a state and behaviors. To create an object, you define a class first. And then, from the class, you can create one or more objects. The objects are instances of a class.


"""


# To define a class, you use the class keyword followed by the class name. For example, the following defines a Person class:
class Person:
    pass


# To create an object from the Person class, you use the class name followed by parentheses (), like calling a function:
person = Person()

# In this example, the person is an instance of the Person class. Classes are callable.
