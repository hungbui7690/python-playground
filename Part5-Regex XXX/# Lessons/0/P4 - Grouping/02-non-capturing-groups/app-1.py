NON-CAPTURING GROUP

Introduction to the Python regex non-capturing group

- Regular expressions have two types of groups:

    Capturing groups
    Non-capturing groups

- So far, you learned how to use a capturing group to extract information from a bigger match or rematch the previous matched group using a backreference.

- To do that, you create a capturing group, you place a pattern (or a rule) inside the parentheses, for example:

        (X)

- This syntax captures whatever match X inside the match so that you can access it via the group() method of the Match object.

- Sometimes, you may want to create a group but donâ€™t want to capture it in the groups of the match. To do that, you can use a non-capturing group with the following syntax:

        (?:X)

import re


# The following example illustrates how to use the capturing groups to capture the major and minor versions of Python in the string "Python 3.10"
s = "Python 3.10"
pattern = "(\d+)\.(\d+)"

match = re.search(pattern, s)

# show the whole match
print(match.group())

# show the groups
for group in match.groups():
    print(group)

# 3.10
# 3
# 10


# The following pattern matches one or more digits followed by the literal string (.) and one or more digits:
# (\d+)\.(\d+)

# It has two capturing groups. They capture the digits before and after the literal (.):
# 3
# 10
