Word Boundary

- A string has the following positions that qualify as word boundaries:

    1. Before the first character in the string if the first character is a word character (\w).
    2. Between two characters in the string if the first character is a word character (\w) and the other is not (\W â€“ inverse character set of the word character \w).
    3. After the last character in a string if the last character is the word character (\w)

- The following picture shows the word boundary positions in the string "PYTHON 3!": pic

- In this example, the "PYTHON 3!" string has four word boundary positions:

    Before the letter P (criteria #1)
    After the letter N (criteria #2)
    Before the digit 3 (criteria #2)
    After the digit 3 (criteria #2)

- Regular expressions use the \b to represent a word boundary. For example, you can use the \b to match the whole word using the following pattern:

    r'\bword\b'


"""


# The following example matches the word Python in a string:

import re

s = "CPython is the implementation of Python in C"
matches = re.finditer("Python", s)
for match in matches:
    print(match.group())
# Python
# Python
# It returns two matches, one in the word CPython and another in the word Python.


# However, if you use the word boundary \b, the program returns one match:
s = "CPython is the implementation of Python in C"
matches = re.finditer(r"\bPython\b", s)
for match in matches:
    print(match.group())
# Python


# In this example, the '\bPython\b' pattern match the whole word Python in the string 'CPython is the implementation of Python in C'.


# Summary
# The \b represents a word boundary in a string.
# Use the r'\bword\b' pattern uses the \b to match the whole word
