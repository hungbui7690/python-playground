# 4) Classes
# All classes are callable. When you call a class, you get a new instance of the class. For example:
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start=1):
        self.count = start

    def increase(self):
        self.count += 1

    def value(self):
        return self.count


# 5) Methods
# Methods are functions bound to an object, therefore, theyâ€™re also callable. For example:
print(callable(Counter.increase))  # True


# 6) Instances of a class
# If a class implements the __call__ method, all instances of the class are callable:
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start=1):
        self.count = start

    def increase(self):
        self.count += 1

    def value(self):
        return self.count

    def __call__(self):
        self.increase()


counter = Counter()
counter()

print(callable(counter))  # True


# Summary
# An object is callable when it can be called using the () operator.
# Use the Python callable built-in function to check if an object is callable or not.
