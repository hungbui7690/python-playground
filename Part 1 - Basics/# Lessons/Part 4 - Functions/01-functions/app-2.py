# Passing information to Python functions
# Suppose that you want to greet users by their names. To do it, you need to specify a name in parentheses of the function definition as follows:
# The name is called a function parameter or simply a parameter.
# When you add a parameter to the function definition, you can use it as a variable inside the function body:
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hi {name}")


# When you call a function with a parameter, you need to pass the information. For example:
greet("John")  # Hi John


# The value that you pass into a function is called an argument. In this example 'John' is an argument.
# Also, you can call the function by passing a variable into it:
first_name = "Jane"
greet(first_name)  # Hi Jane
# In this example, the first_name variable is also the argument of the greet() function.


"""
Parameters vs. Arguments

    Sometimes, parameters and arguments are used interchangeably. Itâ€™s important to distinguish between the parameters and arguments of a function.

    A parameter is a piece of information that a function needs. And you specify the parameter in the function definition. For example, the greet() function has a parameter called name.

    An argument is a piece of data that you pass into the function. For example, the text string 'John' or the variable jane is the function argument.
