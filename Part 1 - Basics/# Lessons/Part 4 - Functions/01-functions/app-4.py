# Python functions with multiple parameters
# A function can have zero, one, or multiple parameters.
# The following example defines a function called sum() that calculates the sum of two numbers:
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b


total = sum(10, 20)
print(total)  # 30

# In this example, the sum() function has two parameters a and b, and returns the sum of them.
# When a function has multiple parameters, you need to use a comma to separate them.
# When you call the function, you need to pass all the arguments. If you pass more or fewer arguments to the function, youâ€™ll get an error.

    Summary

        A Python function is a reusable named block of code that performs a task or returns a value.
        Use the def keyword to define a new function. A function consists of function definition and body.
        A function can have zero or more parameters. If a function has one or more parameters, you need to pass the same number of arguments into it.
        A function can perform a job or return a value. Use the return statement to return a value from a function.
