for Loop with Range


"""

# Using Python for loop to calculate the sum of a sequence
# The following example uses the for loop statement to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100:
sum = 0
for num in range(10):
    sum += num

print(sum)


# By the way, if youâ€™re a mathematician, you can use the simple formula:
n = 9
sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
print(sum)
