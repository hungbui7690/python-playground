"""
Set Intersection
- In Python, you can use the set intersection() method or set intersection operator (&) to intersect two or more sets:

    new_set = set1.intersection(set2, set3)
    new_set = set1 & set2 & set3

- The intersection() method and & operator have the same performance.
- When intersecting two or more sets, youâ€™ll get a new set consisting of elements that exist in all sets.

- The set intersection has many useful applications. For example, you can use set intersections to find the common favorites of two friends on a social networking application or to search for common skills of two or more employees on an HR application.
