Comparison Operators
- Python has six comparison operators, which are as follows:

    Less than ( < )
    Less than or equal to (<=)
    Greater than (>)
    Greater than or equal to (>=)
    Equal to ( == )
    Not equal to ( != )

- These comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either True or False.
- You can use these comparison operators to compare both numbers and strings.

"""

# The following example uses the Less Than (<) operator to compare two numbers:
print(10 < 20)

# The following example uses the less than operator (<) to compare two strings:
print("apple" < "orange")  # True
print("banana" < "apple")  # False
# The expression 'apple' < 'orange' returns True because the letter a in apple is before the letter o in orange.
# Similarly, the 'banana' < 'apple' returns False because the letter 'b' is after the letter 'a'.

# The following example shows how to use the less than or equal to operator to compare two numbers:
print(20 <= 20)  # True
print(10 <= 20)  # True
print(30 <= 30)  # True
