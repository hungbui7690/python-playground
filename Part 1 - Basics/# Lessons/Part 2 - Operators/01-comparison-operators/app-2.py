Comparison Operators
- Python has six comparison operators, which are as follows:

    Less than ( < )
    Less than or equal to (<=)
    Greater than (>)
    Greater than or equal to (>=)
    Equal to ( == )
    Not equal to ( != )

- These comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either True or False.
- You can use these comparison operators to compare both numbers and strings.

"""

# Equal To operator (==)
# The following example uses the equal to operator (==) to compare two numbers:
print(20 == 10)
print(20 == 20)

# And the following example uses the equal to operator (==) to compare two strings:
print("apple" == "apple")  # True
print("apple" == "orange")  # False


# Not Equal To operator (!=)
# For example, the following uses the not equal to operator to compare two numbers:
print(20 != 10)
print(20 != 20)

# The following example uses the not equal to operator to compare two strings:
print("apple" != "apple")
print("apple" != "orange")

  Summary
  
    A comparison operator compares two values and returns a boolean value, either True or False.
    Python has six comparison operators: less than (<), less than or equal to (<=), greater than (>), greater than or equal to (>=), equal to (==), and not equal to (!=).
