"""
Boolean
- The boolean data type has two values: True and False.
- Note that the boolean values True and False start with the capital letters (T) and (F).

"""

# The following example defines two boolean variables:
is_active = True
is_admin = False

# When you compare two numbers, Python returns the result as a boolean value. For example:
print(20 > 10)
print(20 < 10)

# Also, comparing two strings results in a boolean value:
print("a" < "b")
print("a" > "b")
