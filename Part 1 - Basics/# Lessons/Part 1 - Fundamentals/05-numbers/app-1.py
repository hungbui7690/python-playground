# Integers
# The integers are numbers such as -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, .. and they have type int.
# You can use Math operators like +, -, *, and / to form expressions that include integers. For example:
print(10 + 20)
print(10 - 20)
print(10 * 20)
print(10 / 20)

# To calculate exponents, you use two multiplication symbols (**). For example:
print(3**3)
print(20 / (10 + 10))
