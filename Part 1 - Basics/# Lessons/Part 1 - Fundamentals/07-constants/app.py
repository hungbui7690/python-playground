Constants
- Sometimes, you may want to store values in variables. But you don’t want to change these values throughout the execution of the program.
- To do it in other programming languages, you can use constants. The constants are like variables but their values don’t change during the program execution.
- The bad news is that Python doesn’t support constants.

"""

# To work around this, you use all capital letters to name a variable to indicate that the variable should be treated as a constant. For example:

FILE_SIZE_LIMIT = 2000

# When encountering variables like these, you should not change their values. These variables are constant by convention, not by rules.

"""
  Summary
  - Python doesn’t have built-in constant types.
  - By convention, Python uses a variable whose name contains all capital letters to define a constant.
