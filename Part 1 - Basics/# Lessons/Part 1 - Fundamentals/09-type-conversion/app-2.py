# 4) Getting the type of a value
# To get the type of value, you use the type(value) function. For example:
print(type(100))  # int
print(type(2.0))  # float
print(type("Hello"))  # str
print(type(True))  # <class 'bool'>
# In front of each type, you see the class keyword. It isn’t important for now. And you’ll learn more about the class later.
