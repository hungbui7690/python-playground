# Getting the length of a string
# To get the length of a string, you use the len() function. For example: 
str = "Python String"
str_len = len(str)
print(str_len)


# Slicing strings
# Slicing allows you to get a substring from a string. For example:
str = "Python String"
print(str[0:2])
# The str[0:2] returns a substring that includes the character from the index 0 (included) to 2 (excluded).
