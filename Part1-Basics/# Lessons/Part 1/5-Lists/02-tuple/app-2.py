Tuples

# Assigning a tuple
# Even though you canâ€™t change a tuple, you can assign a new tuple to a variable that references a tuple. For example:

colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors)

colors = ("Cyan", "Magenta", "Yellow", "black")
print(colors)


"""
  Summary

      Tuples are immutable lists.
      Use tuples when you want to define a list that cannot change.
