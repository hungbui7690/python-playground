"""
The pass statement is a statement that does nothing. It’s just a placeholder for the code that you’ll write in the future.

When you run the code that contains a pass statement, the Python interpreter will treat the pass statement as a single statement. As a result, it doesn’t issue a syntax error.

Technically, you can use the pass statement in many statement in Python.
