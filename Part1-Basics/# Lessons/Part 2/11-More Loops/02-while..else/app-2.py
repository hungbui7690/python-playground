# The following shows the new version of the program that uses the while else statement:

basket = [
    {"fruit": "apple", "qty": 20},
    {"fruit": "banana", "qty": 30},
    {"fruit": "orange", "qty": 10},
]

fruit = input("Enter a fruit:")

index = 0

while index < len(basket):
    item = basket[index]
    # check the fruit name
    if item["fruit"] == fruit:
        print(f"The basket has {item['qty']} {item['fruit']}(s)")
        found_it = True
        break

    index += 1
else:
    qty = int(input(f"Enter the qty for {fruit}:"))
    basket.append({"fruit": fruit, "qty": qty})
    print(basket)


""" 
    In this program, the else clause replaces the need of having the found_it flag and the if statement after the loop.

    If the fruit is not found, the while loop is terminated normally and the else clause will be executed to add a new fruit to the list.

    However, if the fruit is found, the while loop will be encountered the break statement and terminated prematurely. In this case, the else clause wonâ€™t be executed.
