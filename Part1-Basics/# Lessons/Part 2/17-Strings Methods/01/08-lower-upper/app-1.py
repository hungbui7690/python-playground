LOWER

- The lower() is a string method that allows you to return a copy of a string with all characters converted to lowercase.

- The following shows the syntax of the lower() method:

    str.lower()

- The lower() method has no parameters.

- Note that the lower() method doesnâ€™t change the original string. It just returns a copy of the original string with all characters converted to lowercase.

- If you want to return a copy of a string with all characters converted to uppercase, you use the string upper() method.

"""

# The following example shows you how to use the lower() method to return a copy of a string with all characters converted to lowercase:

s = "Python Lowercase"
new_s = s.lower()

print(s)
print(new_s)
