TKINTER SCROLLEDTEXT

Introduction to the Tkinter ScrolledText widget

- So far, youâ€™ve learned how to create a Text widget and how to link a vertical Scrollbar to the text widget.
- To make it more convenient, Tkinter provides you with the ScrolledText widget which does the same things as a text widget linked to a vertical scroll bar.

- To use the ScrolledText widget, you need to import the ScrolledText class from the tkinter.scrolledtext module.
- Technically, the ScrolledText class inherits from the Text class.

- The ScrolledText widget uses a Frame widget inserted between the container and the Text widget to hold the Scrollbar widget.
- Therefore, the ScrolledText has the same properties and methods as the Text widget. In addition, the geometry manager methods including pack, grid, and place are restricted to the Frame.

# The following program illustrates how to create a ScrolledText widget:

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter.scrolledtext import ScrolledText


root = tk.Tk()
root.title("ScrolledText Widget")


st = ScrolledText(root, width=50, height=10)
st.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, side=tk.LEFT, expand=True)

root.mainloop()


"""
How it works.
- First, import the tkinter module and the ScrolledText class from the tkinter.scrolledtext module.
- Second, create the root window and set its title to 'ScrolledText Widget'.
- Third, create a new ScrolledText widget and display it on the root window.
- Finally, start the main loop.
